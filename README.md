The developed System uses the SSL Shared Vision to get the Knowledge about the positions of all objects. On these information a Particle Filter is run for object tracking. Some heuristical functions are implemented for getting information about ball collisions, and at the end a Prolog Rule System analyses if some of the rules given for the SSL are broken. The feedback is given on a QT and OpenGL-based GUI.
